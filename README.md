# NerdDeck

Welcome to NerdDeck, a project initiated during the first semester of my Master's program at [TH Rosenheim](https://www.th-rosenheim.de) in the course "Concepts of Programming Languages." In this project, I will be comparing two programming languages, [Go](https://go.dev) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org), within the context of functional programming.

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring the paradigms of functional programming in the context of two distinct programming languages: Go and Haskell.

## Goals

- Compare and contrast the key features of Go and Haskell as functional programming languages.
- Provide practical examples and use cases to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each language.
